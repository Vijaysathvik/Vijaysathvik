# Jangapally Vijay Sathvik —  Aerospace Undergrad @ IIT Kharagpur

**B.tech + M.tech (Dual Degree, 5 yrs) in Aerospace Engineering — IIT Kharagpur**  
I build full-stack systems and reusable engineering tools. I enjoy projects where systems, data and performance meet: fast APIs, real-time apps, and algorithmic systems that scale.

- 🔭 Current: polishing backend systems, contributing to open-source web projects and preparing GSoC-quality proposals.
- 🧩 Strengths: Fullstack (React / Node / Next), FastAPI, PostgreSQL/Prisma, MongoDB, algorithmic C++.
- 💡 Past internships & projects: Waitplay (Full-Stack POS system), Tomato (Fullstack food-ordering app), Flight-Path Optimization (Dijkstra based). (Details in pinned repos.)
